# File-Transfer-Application-GUI-Based-with-multiple-servers-and-clients

We developed a file Transfer Protocol that is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections 
between the client and the server.

Methodology:
•	Client should be able to upload files to the server. 
•	Client also downloads files from server.
•	Client can also view the list of files at server end.
•	Client can also delete any file from server.
•	When the file is uploaded or downloaded, it should be intact, i.e., it should retain its features. For instance, if it is executable, it should be able to run, or if it is an image, the image must be same as the original file.
•	Client only needs to authenticate the server. The server need not authenticate client.

Technical Specs
•	Python 
•	Eel for connecting front-end.

Applications:
•	Google Drive
•	Airforshare
•	One Drive
